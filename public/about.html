<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, everyone. My name is Al Amin Choyon and you can call me by my first or last name, anything you prefer. 
  My last name is not my family name, itâ€™s rather my nickname.I am majoring in Computer Science from CUNY York College.
  I am focusing in Software Engineering/Development and my dream company to work with is Google.</p>

<p>One thing about myself that I think would or would not surprise people is that I'm a multilingual. 
  English, Bengali, and Hindi are the languages that I can speak fluently and write. 
  The fourth language is Spanish, which I am learning right now. </p>
